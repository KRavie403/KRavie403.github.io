abstract: Due to the increasing use of OTT services, many people are being exposed to one-way media for extended periods[1]. This has a negative impact on the developmental process of infants and toddlers. Therefore, this paper aims to develop interactive learning content that allows infants and toddlers to participate actively in learning by following the movements on the screen for healthier media exposure. Using the built-in camera of the OTT set-top box, user motion recognition was implemented to assess whether the infants and toddlers correctly perform the actions required by the content. The motion recognition was achieved using MediaPipe Holistic to detect movements in real-time. Additionally, object recognition for learning materials was suggested using a Custom CNN model, allowing the system to determine their usage. The object recognition model achieved an accuracy of 85.71%.

## **Abstract**
&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the increasing use of OTT services, many people are being exposed to one-way media for extended periods[1]. This negatively impacts the developmental process of infants and toddlers. Therefore, this paper aims to develop interactive learning content that allows infants and toddlers to actively participate in learning by following the movements on the screen for healthier media exposure. Using the built-in camera of the OTT set-top box, user motion recognition was implemented to assess whether the infants and toddlers correctly perform the actions required by the content. The motion recognition was achieved using MediaPipe Holistic to detect movements in real-time. Additionally, object recognition for learning materials was suggested using a Custom CNN model, allowing the system to determine their usage. The object recognition model achieved an accuracy of 85.71%.
